# Iteration 3:
# ------------
* ruby is now a systemwide essential (dot-deploy)
* more comments and organization of installation scripts
* dot-help:
  - must be stronger, namely, to cover most use cases
  - must include deploy, stow, unstow and purge
* dot-(un)stow:
  - stronger
  - must check for each in $@ whether it's a directory before doing anything
  - must show error if one of them is not a directory
* major revision of everrrrry file: proper comments and indentation  on every single one of them
* sman/swatch:
  - BUG: make sure those processes are killed when killing i3
    approach: traps, SIG -> sman -> SIG -> swatches
    SIGs are: TERM, HUP and INT
