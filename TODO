# Iteration 3:
# ------------
* ~/.dotenv: a YAML file read by a ruby script to set custom environment variables
  - (https://gist.github.com/SteveBenner/588fff3e54636f3d8297)
  - command name is: dot-env
  - ~/.zsh/profile.d/99-dotenv -> DOT_ENV_CFG=~/.dotenv ->  ~/.local/dot/bin/dot-env
  - ~/.dotenv must be ignored by dot-purge
  - dot-env will prevent resetting these env vars:
    - DOT_HOME
    - DOT_PATH
    - PATH
    - TERM
    - TERMINFO
    - CPATH
    - LIBRARY_PATH
    - LD_RUN_PATH
    - PKG_CONFIG_PATH
* rename xkb_update to config-xmodmap
* ruby is now a systemwide essential (dot-deploy)
* more comments and organization of installation scripts
* Essential environment variable: DOT_BRANCH
  - it will decide what git branch is going to be checked out at DOT_HOME when dot-updating
  - default value is: develop, set at ~/.zsh/profile.d/10-dot
* dot-update
  - will git-stash changes on DOT_HOME before pulling
  - update job for  oh-my-zsh: zsh
* dot-help:
  - must be stronger, namely, to cover most use cases
  - must include deploy, stow, unstow and purge
* dot-(un)stow:
  - stronger
  - must check for each in $@ whether it's a directory before doing anything
  - must show error if one of them is not a directory
* dot-reload: alias for 'source ~/.zshenv; source ~/.zshrc'
* major revision of everrrrry file: proper comments and indentation  on every single one of them

# Iteration 4:
# ------------
* lightdm greeter customization
