# CPATH specifies a list of directories to be searched as if specified with -I,
# but after any paths given with -I options on the command line.
#  This environment variable is used regardless of which language is
# being preprocessed.

# The value of LIBRARY_PATH is a colon-separated list of directories, much like PATH.  When configured as a
# native compiler, GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching for special linker files, if it
# can't find them using GCC_EXEC_PREFIX.  Linking using GCC also uses these directories when searching for
# ordinary libraries for the -l option (but directories specified with -L come first).
export LIBRARY_PATH=${DOT_PATH}/lib

# Add this directory to the runtime library search path.
# each time a binary is linked (rpath)
export LD_RUN_PATH=${DOT_PATH}/lib

# pkg-config search path
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${DOT_PATH}/lib/pkgconfig
